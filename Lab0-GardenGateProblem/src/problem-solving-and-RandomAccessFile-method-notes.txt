RandomAccessFile methods
Seek -
public void seek (long pos) throws IOException
Sets the file pointer measured from the beginning of this file. Start is 0. Negative value causes error.

Write -
public void write (byte[] b) throws IOException
Writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to this file, starting at the current file pointer.

Read -
public int read() throws IOException
Reads a byte of data from this file. The byte is returned as an integer in the range 0 to 255 (0x00-0x0ff). This method blocks if no input is yet available.
Although RandomAccessFile is not a subclass of InputStream, this method behaves in exactly the same way as the InputStream.read() method of InputStream.

Close -
public void close() throws IOException
Closes this random access file stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream. A closed random access file cannot perform input or output operations and cannot be reopened.
If this file has an associated channel then the channel is closed as well.
