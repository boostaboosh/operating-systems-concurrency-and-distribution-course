A large ornamental garden is open to members of the public
who can enter through either one of two gates at the lower
and upper part of the garden. The management want to
determine how many people are in the garden at any one time.
They design a computer system to do this.

problem-solving:

first thoughts:
Two gates thread instances (top and bottom)
will access a shared synchronised garden.
The garden will access the file as in practicals 0 and 1.

Actually, I need to run the gate thread instances at the same time,
so instead of having two instances of a gate thread, one called top
and one called bottom, in the same program; I will run two programs
at the same time, and each one will create a gate thread.
I will give gate threads a name instance variable so that I can
distinguish between top and bottom gates by calling one threads top,
and the other thread bottom.
